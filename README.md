# todo-tapir-http4s-doobie

## Description

Simple rest-api HTTP server for todo-list service based on tapir, http4s, and doobie. PostgreSQL is used for storage.

his/her existing tasks, delete tasks, and get added tasks applying filters by current task `status` and/or `substring match` 
in description.
